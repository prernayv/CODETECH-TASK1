**Domain:** DATA SCIENCE

**Duration:** JULY TO AUGUST

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The primary objective is to showcase different functionalities of NLTK, including text tokenization, frequency distribution analysis, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and parsing.

**Objectives**

To understand and utilize the core functionalities of the NLTK library.

To perform text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

To analyze the frequency distribution of words in a text.

To identify and remove stop words from a text.

To perform POS tagging and named entity recognition.

To parse sentences using custom grammar rules.

**Key Activities**


   **Corpus Access and Text Processing:**

Downloading and accessing various corpora such as the Brown Corpus and the Gutenberg Corpus.

Tokenizing text from these corpora into words and sentences.

   **Text Tokenization and Frequency Analysis:**

Tokenizing a sample text on blockchain technology.

Calculating the frequency distribution of words in the text.

Identifying the top 10 most common words.


   **Stemming and Lemmatization:**

Applying different stemming algorithms (Porter, Lancaster, Snowball).

Lemmatizing words to get their base form.

   **Stop Words Removal:**

Listing and removing English stop words using NLTK's stop words corpus.

  **Part-of-Speech Tagging and Named Entity Recognition:**

Performing POS tagging on sample sentences.

Identifying named entities using NLTK's NER capabilities.

   **Sentence Parsing:**

Defining and applying custom grammar rules for noun phrase (NP) chunking.

Parsing a sample sentence based on the defined grammar.


**Technologies Used**
Python: The programming language used to write the scripts.

NLTK: The primary library used for NLP tasks.

Corpora: Various text corpora from NLTK such as the Brown Corpus, Gutenberg Corpus, stop words, etc.
